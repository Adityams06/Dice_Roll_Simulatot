## How to setup a development environment

    GNU/Linux Installation Instructions

Python is probably already installed on your GNU/Linux system. You can check if Python is installed by running this command from a terminal:

python3 -V

Install all dependencies for Debian 9

apt update
apt install -y python3-pip

    Windows Installation Instructions

The easiest way to install Python (and many other common programs) for Windows is through ninite. Ninite is a website that allows you to install many programs at once without accidentally installing adware. The ninite download program can be left on your system and used as an updater in the future.

For all python files, use Notepad++ to change the end of line from UNIX / OS X Format to Windows Format.


Run with this command:

python3 DiceRoll.py

**Both the files are required for the program to run**
